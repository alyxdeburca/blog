## Software development process

Based largely on Chinese Whispers, no formal communicationz

A system was needed. **Waterfall** technique was brought in from construction/engineering

**Agile** process is iterative and designed specifically for software development but can be more slow to begin with.

## Waterfall Technique

System and Software requirements

1. Analysis: *captured in a product requirement document*
2. Design: *resulting in models, schema, and business rules*
3. Coding: *the development, proving, and integration of software*
4. Testing:
5. Operations:

Based on engineering and construction project management methodology  
Linear process with each stage usually depending on the previous stages(s)  
Lots of documentation  
Focus on process over prodect

## Agile Technique

The agile software development life cycle is the structured series of stages that a product goes through as it moves from beginning to end  
It contains six phases:  

1. concept
2. inception
3. iteration
4. release
5. maintenance
6. retirement

<br>

+ Flexible, collaborative approach to a software project
+ Emphasis on the Product rather than the Process
+ Iteration: when dealing with errors, go back to a prior step and work through the process again
+ Self-organizing teams - Introspection, Reflective, Mindful!
+ Simple design
+ Involve users at every stage
+ Accept changing requirements as a given
+ Short "Sprints" to produce "quick wins" and timely feedback

### The Agile Manifesto

+ individuals and interactions over processes and tools
+ working software over comprehensive documentation
+ customer collaboration over contract negotiation
+ responding to change over following a plan

Examples of Agile methodologies include:

+ Scrum
+ Extreme Programming
+ Rational Unified Process (More a Business Framework - IBM!)
+ PRINCE2 - Used in many (UK) Government and public projects

## DevOps

+ DevOps is a set of practices combining software development and IT operations
+ It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality
+ DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile way of working
+ Other than it being a cross-functional combination (and portmanteau) of the terms and concepts for "development" and "operations", academics and practitioners have not developed a universal definition for the term DevOps.
+ Most often, DevOps is characterized by key principles: shared ownership, workflow automation, and rapid feedback.
