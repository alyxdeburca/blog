### **Work and Efficiency**
Efficient, working model
```python
myList = [85, 24, 63, 45, 18, 31, 96, 50]
key = 17
location = None
for index in range(len(myList)):
    if myList[index] == key:
        location = index
if location == None:
    print("Key not found")
else:
    print("Key found at: ", location)
```
Inefficient, non-working model
```python
myList = [17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17]
key = 17
for index in range(len(myList)):
    if myList[index] == key:
        location = index
print("Key found at: ", location)
```
Formula for efficency
```python
def algo(num_hits, dataset):
    print(str(num_hits+2*dataset+3))
```
